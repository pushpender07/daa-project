# Maze Generator and Solver - DSA Project

## Project Overview

This project implements a comprehensive maze generation and solving application using fundamental Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) concepts. The application generates random mazes and solves them using three different pathfinding algorithms, with an interactive GUI visualization.

### Key Features
- **Maze Generation**: Uses Recursive Backtracking with Depth-First Search (DFS)
- **Three Solving Algorithms**: BFS, DFS, and A* pathfinding
- **Custom Data Structures**: Stack, Queue, and MinHeap implemented from scratch
- **GUI Visualization**: Interactive interface using tkinter
- **Customizable Endpoints**: Click to set custom start and end points anywhere on the maze
- **Performance Comparison**: Compare different algorithms' efficiency

## Algorithms Implemented

### 1. Maze Generation - Recursive Backtracking (DFS)

**Concept**: Creates a perfect maze (maze with exactly one path between any two points) using depth-first search with a stack.

**Pseudo-code**:
```
function generateMaze(grid):
    initialize all cells as walls
    start_cell = (1, 1)
    mark start_cell as path
    
    stack = new Stack()
    stack.push(start_cell)
    visited = new 2D array of False
    visited[start_cell] = True
    
    while stack is not empty:
        current = stack.peek()
        neighbors = getUnvisitedNeighbors(current, visited)
        
        if neighbors is not empty:
            chosen = random neighbor from neighbors
            removeWallBetween(current, chosen)
            mark chosen as path
            visited[chosen] = True
            stack.push(chosen)
        else:
            stack.pop()
```

**Complexity Analysis**:
- **Time Complexity**: O(R × C) where R = rows, C = columns
  - Each cell is visited exactly once
  - Wall removal is O(1) operation
- **Space Complexity**: O(R × C)
  - Stack can grow up to R × C in worst case (long path)
  - Visited array is R × C

### 2. Breadth-First Search (BFS)

**Concept**: Explores the maze level by level using a queue, guaranteeing the shortest path in an unweighted graph.

**Pseudo-code**:
```
function solveBFS(maze, start, end):
    queue = new Queue()
    queue.enqueue(start)
    visited = new 2D array of False
    parent = new 2D array of None
    visited[start] = True
    
    while queue is not empty:
        current = queue.dequeue()
        
        if current == end:
            return reconstructPath(parent, end)
        
        for each neighbor of current:
            if neighbor is valid and not visited:
                visited[neighbor] = True
                parent[neighbor] = current
                queue.enqueue(neighbor)
    
    return empty path  // No solution found
```

**Complexity Analysis**:
- **Time Complexity**: O(R × C)
  - Each cell visited at most once
  - Each edge (connection between cells) examined once
- **Space Complexity**: O(R × C)
  - Queue can contain up to R × C elements
  - Visited and parent arrays each take R × C space
- **Optimality**: Guarantees shortest path

---

### 3. Depth-First Search (DFS)

**Concept**: Explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking, using a stack.

**Pseudo-code**:
```
function solveDFS(maze, start, end):
    stack = new Stack()
    stack.push(start)
    visited = new 2D array of False
    parent = new 2D array of None
    visited[start] = True
    
    while stack is not empty:
        current = stack.pop()
        
        if current == end:
            return reconstructPath(parent, end)
        
        for each neighbor of current:
            if neighbor is valid and not visited:
                visited[neighbor] = True
                parent[neighbor] = current
                stack.push(neighbor)
    
    return empty path  // No solution found
```

**Complexity Analysis**:
- **Time Complexity**: O(R × C)
  - Each cell visited at most once
  - Similar to BFS in worst case
- **Space Complexity**: O(R × C)
  - Stack depth can be R × C in worst case (long path)
  - Generally uses less memory than BFS in practice
- **Optimality**: Does NOT guarantee shortest path

### 4. A* (A-Star) Algorithm

**Concept**: Informed search algorithm using heuristic (Manhattan distance) to efficiently find the optimal path. Uses a priority queue (MinHeap) to always explore the most promising path first.

**Pseudo-code**:
```
function solveAStar(maze, start, end):
    minHeap = new MinHeap()
    minHeap.push((0, start))  // (f_score, position)
    
    g_score = new 2D array initialized to infinity
    g_score[start] = 0
    
    f_score = new 2D array initialized to infinity
    f_score[start] = heuristic(start, end)
    
    visited = new 2D array of False
    parent = new 2D array of None
    
    while minHeap is not empty:
        current = minHeap.pop()
        
        if visited[current]:
            continue
        
        visited[current] = True
        
        if current == end:
            return reconstructPath(parent, end)
        
        for each neighbor of current:
            if neighbor is valid and not visited:
                tentative_g = g_score[current] + 1
                
                if tentative_g < g_score[neighbor]:
                    parent[neighbor] = current
                    g_score[neighbor] = tentative_g
                    f_score[neighbor] = tentative_g + heuristic(neighbor, end)
                    minHeap.push((f_score[neighbor], neighbor))
    
    return empty path

function heuristic(pos1, pos2):
    // Manhattan distance
    return |pos1.row - pos2.row| + |pos1.col - pos2.col|
```

**Complexity Analysis**:
- **Time Complexity**: O(R × C × log(R × C))
  - Each cell visited at most once
  - Each heap operation (push/pop) is O(log n)
  - In worst case, all R × C cells in heap
- **Space Complexity**: O(R × C)
  - Heap can contain up to R × C elements
  - Multiple 2D arrays (g_score, f_score, visited, parent)
- **Optimality**: Guarantees shortest path with admissible heuristic
- **Efficiency**: Generally explores fewer nodes than BFS due to heuristic guidance

## Data Structures

### 1. Stack (LIFO - Last In First Out)

**Operations**:
- `push(item)`: O(1) - Add item to top
- `pop()`: O(1) - Remove and return top item
- `peek()`: O(1) - View top item without removing
- `is_empty()`: O(1) - Check if stack is empty

**Used in**: Maze generation (DFS), DFS solving algorithm

---

### 2. Queue (FIFO - First In First Out)

**Operations**:
- `enqueue(item)`: O(1) - Add item to rear
- `dequeue()`: O(n)* - Remove and return front item
- `front()`: O(1) - View front item without removing
- `is_empty()`: O(1) - Check if queue is empty

*Note: O(n) due to list shifting. Can be optimized to O(1) using circular buffer or deque, but kept simple for educational purposes.

**Used in**: BFS solving algorithm

---

### 3. MinHeap (Priority Queue)

**Operations**:
- `push(item)`: O(log n) - Insert item and maintain heap property
- `pop()`: O(log n) - Remove and return minimum item
- `peek()`: O(1) - View minimum item without removing
- `is_empty()`: O(1) - Check if heap is empty

**Heap Properties**:
- Complete binary tree stored as array
- Parent at index i has children at 2i+1 and 2i+2
- Min heap: parent is always smaller than children

**Used in**: A* algorithm for efficient priority-based retrieval

## Performance Comparison

| Algorithm | Time Complexity | Space Complexity | Path Optimality | Best Use Case |
|-----------|----------------|------------------|-----------------|---------------|
| BFS | O(R × C) | O(R × C) | ✓ Shortest | Unweighted graphs, shortest path needed |
| DFS | O(R × C) | O(R × C) | ✗ Not optimal | Memory-efficient, any path acceptable |
| A* | O(R × C × log(R × C)) | O(R × C) | ✓ Shortest | Large graphs, heuristic available |

### Practical Performance (31×41 maze):

Typical solving times on standard hardware:
- **BFS**: 2-5 ms - Explores many cells, guaranteed shortest
- **DFS**: 1-4 ms - May explore fewer cells, path may be longer
- **A***: 1-3 ms - Most efficient, explores fewest cells due to heuristic

*Note: Times vary based on maze structure and solution path length*
